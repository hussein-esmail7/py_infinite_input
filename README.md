# Python templates

Hello! This repository is mainly for myself for files I might need time and time again. Though it is fine for you to use. If you have anything you think you can contribute, please help my code be better!

# cli.py
This file asks for input infinite amount of times until the user types one of the exit commands ("exit", "q", "quit", etc.). This is mainly used for interface programs, that would take many commands within the program. 

# send_mail.py
This program is a template if someone wants to send an email through a program. You would hust have to replace the input variables.
