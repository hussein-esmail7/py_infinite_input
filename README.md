# Templates

Hello! This repository is mainly for myself for files I might need time and time again. Though it is fine for you to use. If you have anything you think you can contribute, please help my code be better!

## cli.py, cli.java
These files asks for input infinite amount of times until the user types one of the exit commands ("exit", "q", "quit", etc.) (the .java file currently only supports "exit"). This is mainly used for interface programs, that would take many commands within the program. 

## template.cpp, template.tex
These files are basic boilerplate files for the C++ programming language and LaTeX so you can get working on the important stuff faster.

## selenium_template.py
This program is a template for interacting with websites using selenium. This also has the capability of running the programs in the background so you don't have to see the webpages as it runs.

## send_mail.py
This program is a template if someone wants to send an email through a program. You would just have to replace the input variables.
